# Overview

- Apollo simplifies the process of extracting large-scale, structured data from unstructured sources like research papers, PDFs, and more. It reduces manual effort by automating the identification and organization of critical data points using machine learning, vectors, chain of thought validation, and other techniques.
- Provides accurate relations, and patterns that would otherwise require extensive manual analysis.
- Built in graph renderer, ensuring flexibility and precision in how the extracted information is categorized and visualized for further use.
